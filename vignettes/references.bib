	abstract = {Encouraging cycling, as part of a wider sustainable mobility strategy, is an increasingly common objective in transport planning institutions worldwide. Emerging evidence shows that providing appropriate high-quality infrastructure can boost local cycling rates. To maximize the benefits and cost-effectiveness of new infrastructure, it is important to build in the right places. Cycle paths, for example, will have the greatest impact if they are constructed along 'desire lines' of greatest latent demand. The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) seeks to inform such decisions by providing an evidence-based support tool that models current and potential future distributions and volumes of cycling across cities and regions. This paper describes this model and its application to case study cities in England. Origin-destination (OD) data, combined with quantitative information at the level of administrative zones, form the basis of the model, which estimates cycling potential as a function of route distance, hilliness and other factors at the OD and area level. Multiple scenarios were generated and interactively displayed. These were: 'Government Target', in which the rate of cycling doubles in England; 'Gender Equality', in which women cycle as much as men; 'Go Dutch', in which English people cycle as much as people in the Netherlands; and 'E-bikes', an exploratory analysis of increasing the distance people are willing to cycle due to new technology. The model is freely available online and can be accessed at [geo8.webarch.net/master/](http://geo8.webarch.net/master/). This paper also explains how the PCT's open source approach allows it to be deployed in new cities and countries. We conclude that the method presented has potential to assist with planning for cycling-dominated cities worldwide, which can in turn assist with the global transition away from fossil fuels.},

	abstract = {There has been much excitement among quantitative geographers about newly available data sets, characterized by high volume, velocity, and variety. This phenomenon is often labeled as “Big Data” and has contributed to methodological and empirical advances, particularly in the areas of visualization and analysis of social networks. However, a fourth v—veracity (or lack thereof)—has been conspicuously lacking from the literature. This article sets out to test the potential for verifying large data sets. It does this by cross-comparing three unrelated estimates of retail flows—human movements from home locations to shopping centers—derived from the following geo-coded sources: (1) a major mobile telephone service provider; (2) a commercial consumer survey; and (3) geotagged Twitter messages. Three spatial interaction models also provided estimates of flow: constrained and unconstrained versions of the “gravity model” and the recently developed “radiation model.” We found positive relationships between all data-based and theoretical sources of estimated retail flows. Based on the analysis, the mobile telephone data fitted the modeled flows and consumer survey data closely, while flows obtained directly from the Twitter data diverged from other sources. The research highlights the importance of verification in flow data derived from new sources and demonstrates methods for achieving this.},

	abstract = {Objectives To examine the association between environmental exposure to takeaway food outlets, takeaway food consumption, and body weight, while accounting for home, work place, and commuting route environments.
Design Population based, cross sectional study, using data on individual participants’ diet and weight, and objective metrics of food environment exposure.
Participants Working adults participating in the Fenland Study, Cambridgeshire, UK (n=5442, aged 29-62 years), who provided home and work addresses and commuting preferences. Takeaway food outlet exposure was derived using data from local authorities for individual environmental domains (at home, at work, and along commuting routes (the shortest route between home and work)), and for exposure in all three domains combined. Exposure was divided into quarters (Q); Q1 being the least exposed and Q4 being the most exposed.
Main outcome measures Self reported consumption of takeaway type food (g/day; pizza, burgers, fried foods, and chips) using food frequency questionnaires, measured body mass index, and cut-offs for body mass index as defined by the World Health Organization.
Results In multiple linear regression models, exposure to takeaway food outlets was positively associated with consumption of takeaway food. Among domains at home, at work, and along commuting routes, associations were strongest in work environments (Q4 v Q1; β coefficient=5.3 g/day, 95\% confidence interval 1.6 to 8.7; P{\textless}0.05), with evidence of a dose-response effect. Associations between exposure in all three domains combined and consumption were greater in magnitude across quarters of exposure (Q4 v Q1; 5.7 g/day, 2.6 to 8.8; P{\textless}0.001), with evidence of a dose-response effect. Combined exposure was especially strongly associated with increased body mass index (Q4 v Q1; body mass index 1.21, 0.68 to 1.74; P{\textless}0.001) and odds of obesity (Q4 v Q1; odds ratio 1.80, 1.28 to 2.53; P{\textless}0.05). There was no evidence of effect modification by sex.
Conclusions Exposure to takeaway food outlets in home, work, and commuting environments combined was associated with marginally higher consumption of takeaway food, greater body mass index, and greater odds of obesity. Government strategies to promote healthier diets through planning restrictions for takeaway food could be most effective if focused around the workplace.},

	abstract = {Policies that stimulate active transportation (walking and bicycling) have been related to heath benefits. This study aims to assess the potential health risks and benefits of promoting active transportation for commuting populations (age groups 16–64) in six European cities. We conducted a health impact assessment using two scenarios: increased cycling and increased walking. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality related to changes in physical activity level, exposure to fine particulate matter air pollution with a diameter \&lt;2.5 μm, as well as traffic fatalities in the cities of Barcelona, Basel, Copenhagen, Paris, Prague, and Warsaw. All scenarios produced health benefits in the six cities. An increase in bicycle trips to 35\% of all trips (as in Copenhagen) produced the highest benefits among the different scenarios analysed in Warsaw 113 (76–163) annual deaths avoided, Prague 61 (29–104), Barcelona 37 (24–56), Paris 37 (18–64) and Basel 5 (3–9). An increase in walking trips to 50\% of all trips (as in Paris) resulted in 19 (3–42) deaths avoided annually in Warsaw, 11(3–21) in Prague, 6 (4–9) in Basel, 3 (2–6) in Copenhagen and 3 (2–4) in Barcelona. The scenarios would also reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the six cities by 1,139 to 26,423 (metric tonnes per year). Policies to promote active transportation may produce health benefits, but these depend of the existing characteristics of the cities. Increased collaboration between health practitioners, transport specialists and urban planners will help to introduce the health perspective in transport policies and promote active transportation.},

	abstract = {This tutorial is an introduction to spatial data in R and map making with R's `base' graphics and the popular graphics package ggplot2. It assumes no prior knowledge of spatial data analysis but prior understanding of the R command line would be beneficial. For people new to R, we recommend working through an `Introduction to R' type tutorial, such as "A (very) short introduction to R" (Torfs and Brauer, 2012) or the more geographically inclined "Short introduction to R" (Harris, 2012). Building on such background material, the following set of exercises is concerned with specific functions for spatial data and visualisation. It is divided into five parts: *Introduction, which provides a guide to R's syntax and preparing for the tutorial *Spatial data in R, which describes basic spatial functions in R *Manipulating spatial data, which includes changing projection, clipping and spatial joins *Map making with ggplot2, a recent graphics package for producing beautiful maps quickly *Taking spatial analysis in R further, a compilation of resources for furthering your skills An up-to-date version of this tutorial is maintained at https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R and the entire tutorial, including the input data can be downloaded as a zip file, as described below. The entire tutorialwas written in RMarkdown, which allows R code to run as the document compiles. Thus all the examples are entirely reproducible. Suggested improvements welcome - please fork, improve and push this document to its original home to ensure its longevity. The tutorial was developed for a series of Short Courses put on by the National Centre for Research Methods, via the TALISMAN node (see geotalisman.org).},
